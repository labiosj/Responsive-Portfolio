            a team of subject matter experts to a set of objectives established by senior leadership. I have worked in
            the end user space since 2001 working in different disciplines in IT to include network, server, GPOs,
            event support. I'm hoping to learn coding to automate some of our processes.</p>

            the military. Outside of work I love to travel, play golf, car racing and run.</p>
